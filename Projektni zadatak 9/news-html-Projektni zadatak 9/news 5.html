			<p class="description">Amazon fires employees for allegedly sharing customer email addresses</p>
			<p>An Amazon employees were fired after sharing customers' email addresses with an unnamed third-party seller, in violation of company policies, Amazon said.</p>
			<p>"The individual responsible for this incident has been terminated from their position, and we are supporting law enforcement in their prosecution," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement Friday.</p>
			<p>Amazon said only email addresses were taken by the employee, not any other customer information. The company has already started emailing affected customers about the incident.</p>
			<p>A third-party seller is a merchant that sells on Amazon's website, though the company declined to provide additional information about this seller. It said the seller has been blocked from Amazon.</p>
			<p>Amazon also declined to provide additional information about the employee, when it discovered the issue or how many people were affected.</p>
