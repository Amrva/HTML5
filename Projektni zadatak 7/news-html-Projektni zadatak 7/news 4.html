			<h2>Best vacation destionations</h2>
			<p class="description">U.S. News Travel's Best Vacations rankings identify the top destinations by region and vacation type. The map and the categories below make it easy to find the list that suits your needs.</p>
			<p>Every day, the magnetic City of Light draws visitors who travel from around the globe to see iconic attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and Notre Dame in real life. But what travelers really fall in love with are the city's quaint cafes, vibrant markets, trendy shopping districts and unmistakable je ne sais quoi charm.</p>
			<p>Considered by many to be a rite of passage for any American, a visit to Yellowstone will leave you in awe of nature's power. Marvel at the kaleidoscopic waters of the Grand Prismatic Spring, catch the hourly show put on by Old Faithful, hike along the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone or simply relax with a picnic at Yellowstone Lake.</p>
			<p>When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see attractions – the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, to name a few – off your bucket list. Additional treasures like St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel can be found in nearby Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds with a twilight stroll through the cobblestone streets of Trastevere.</p>
			<p>Travel to this island – the largest in French Polynesia – if you've been dreaming of a vacation spent lazing in a luxurious overwater bungalow. Beyond the posh resorts, Tahiti boasts black sand beaches, prime snorkeling and surfing conditions, and a bustling capital. The easiest (and cheapest) way to experience this paradise is on a cruise. </p>
